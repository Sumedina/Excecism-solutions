This is a GitHub repository containing my personal solutions to programming exercises from [Exercism](https://www.exercism.org).

I’m currently focusing on JavaScript but plan to explore and practice other languages available on Exercism as well. The purpose of this repository is to track my progress, improve my skills, and keep a public backup of my work.

Thanks to Exercism’s GitHub Sync feature, my solutions are automatically backed up to this repository. This helps ensure my progress is stored safely and makes it easier to share and review over time.

Feel free to explore the solutions and follow my journey as I continue learning!
